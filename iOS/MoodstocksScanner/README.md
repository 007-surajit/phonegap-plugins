# Moodstocks SDK PhoneGap plugin

This plugin is hosted at: [https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-phonegap-demo-app](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-phonegap-demo-app)

## Description

This is a PhoneGap plugin that uses [Moodstocks](http://www.moodstocks.com/) real-time on-device image recognition SDK. So far we only support the iOS platform (tested with PhoneGap v2.3). Plugin for Android platform is under development.

With this plugin, you can easily integrate Moodstocks scanner in your PhoneGap application, which allows you to:
  * Scan image of your choice
  * Scan different types of barcode, both 1D (EAN8, EAN13) and 2D (QR Code, Datamatrix)

We provide a demo application to help you get started.

## Real-time on-device image recognition SDK

The Moodstocks SDK provides a scanner for mobile devices. It recognizes both barcodes and images. Scanning operates on the client-side which lets you create nice augmented reality overlays. Also it even works off-line thanks to a built-in, easy-to-use on-device image signatures synchronization.

To get started (for free!) create an account on [Moodstocks Developer Center](https://developers.moodstocks.com/) and follow the instructions.
